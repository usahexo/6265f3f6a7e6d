#  Governor Steve Bullock Signs Legislation Banning Roulette in Montana

Friday, May 3, 2019: Governor Steve Bullock signs into law House Bill 302, a bill that bans roulette in the state of Montana. The governor says the new law will help to protect Montanans from gambling addiction.

"Roulette can be a very addictive game, and I believe this new law will help to protect our citizens from its harmful effects," Governor Bullock said.

Under the new law, it is illegal to operate a roulette game in Montana. Violators could face up to six months in jail and a $500 fine.

The bill's sponsor, Representative Dan Zolnikov, says he introduced the legislation after hearing from concerned constituents.

"I heard from many people in my district who said they were worried about the effects of roulette on their families and communities," Rep. Zolnikov said. "This bill will help to address those concerns."

Supporters of the bill say it will help to protect Montanans from gambling addiction and create a level playing field for casinos and other gambling establishments in the state.

Opponents of the bill say it could hurt tourism and lead to job losses in the casino industry.

#  Montana Lawmakers Aim to Kill Gambling with New Bill 

On Tuesday, a new bill was introduced in the Montana state legislature that would effectively ban all forms of gambling in the state. The bill, sponsored by Republican Representative Kirk Wagoner, would make it a felony to own or operate a casino, card room, or other form of gaming establishment in Montana. It would also make it a crime to gamble or participate in any form of gambling activity.

The bill is being supported by the Montana Family Foundation, a religious organization that is opposed to gambling on moral grounds. Foundation president Jeff Laszloffy said that the bill is not about putting casinos out of business, but about protecting Montanans from the harm that gambling can cause. "This isn't an anti-casino measure," Laszloffy said. "This is a measure to protect Montanans from themselves."

Opponents of the bill argue that it will devastate the state's economy, and that the majority of people who gamble do so responsibly. They also argue that banning gambling will not keep people from engaging in it, but will simply drive it underground where it will be more dangerous and less regulated.

The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further consideration.

#  Dead Money: The Story of How One Man Beat the Casino at Roulette 

The first time I ever played roulette, I was mesmerized. The little ball bouncing around and the whirling wheel were so captivating that I lost all track of time. In the end, I had gambled away all of my money - and then some.

I didn't know it at the time, but I had just fallen victim to one of the casino's most lucrative schemes: Dead Money.

How does Dead Money work? Let me explain.

The casino has a edge over the player in roulette because it pays out less than what is wagered on even-money bets. For example, if you bet $10 on red and the ball lands on red, the casino only pays out $8.50 - leaving the house with a 50-cent profit.

As you can imagine, this small edge can add up quickly over time. In fact, the house has a 2.7% edge over players who make even-money bets.

This is where Dead Money comes in. The casino doesn't just rely on its edge to make money; it also encourages players to make risky bets in order to increase their losses.

For example, if you bet $10 on black and the ball lands on black, the casino pays out $17 - leaving you with a $6 loss. This may not seem like a lot, but remember that over time these small losses can really add up!

So how does one beat the casino at roulette? By avoiding even-money bets and making instead more favourable propositions such as betting on individual numbers or groups of numbers. For example, betting $10 on black will net you a return of $35 if the ball lands on black - giving you a $25 profit!

Remember: when it comes to gambling, knowledge is power!

#  Is There a Way to Win at Roulette Every Time? 

It is impossible to guarantee winning at roulette every time. However, there are some definite strategies that can improve your chances of winning and limit your losses.

One basic strategy is to bet on the outside bets whenever possible. These bets have lower payouts, but the odds of winning are also much higher. Another strategy is to keep track of where the ball has landed in previous spins, and bet on those numbers accordingly. You can also try using mathematical models to predict where the ball will land, but this is a more advanced technique that not everyone may be able to use effectively.

In the end, there is no foolproof method to winning at roulette every time. However, by using one or more of the strategies mentioned above, you can give yourself a better chance of coming out ahead in the game.

#  Montana Man Wins Over $500,000 Playing Roulette – What’s His Secret?

When you think of the classic American pastime, there’s a good chance that gambling doesn’t spring to mind. But in Montana, one man has been making headlines for winning big at the roulette wheel – and he’s not keeping any secrets about his winning strategy.

Ron Hamilton, a resident of Great Falls, Montana, has won over half a million dollars playing roulette in the last year. And he’s not the only one in his family who’s had some luck – his wife also managed to win $10,000 playing blackjack at a casino in Las Vegas. So what’s their secret?

Hamilton says that he simply bets conservatively and waits for the right opportunity. “I never bet more than I can afford to lose, and I always wait for the right spin,” he says.

This cautious approach seems to have paid off – Hamilton has won thousands of dollars on a number of occasions by picking strategic moments to place his bets. For instance, he often bets when there is a lot of money on the table, since this increases the odds of winning. He also avoids numbers that have been hit too many times, since the chances of them coming up again soon are slim.

Hamilton isn’t the only one who’s been enjoying success at the roulette wheel lately – casinos around the country are reporting increased traffic from gamblers looking to make some easy money. In fact, Nevada saw a 30 percent increase in gambling revenue last year, thanks largely to games like roulette and blackjack.

So if you feel like giving gambling a try, why not head to your nearest casino? Who knows – you might be the next Ron Hamilton!
