#  Hasek Shuts Out Blackjack To Win Series

On Sunday, October 8, 2017, the Chicago Blackhawks took on the Detroit Red Wings in a matchup of two teams fighting for a playoff spot. The game ended 2-0 in favor of the Blackhawks with goaltender Jaroslav Halak making 32 saves for his first shutout of the season. This was also the first time this season that the Red Wings were shut out.

The game-winning goal came 7:37 into the second period when Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane passed to defenseman Duncan Keith who then fired a shot past goaltender Jimmy Howard. The second goal came with just 9 seconds left in the game when Blackhawks forward Brandon Saad scored on an empty net.

This was an important win for the Blackhawks who are currently in third place in the Central Division with a record of 6-3-2. The Red Wings are in sixth place in the Atlantic Division with a record of 5-5-1.

The next game between these two teams is on December 3, 2017, at Chicago’s United Center.

#  Hasek's Huge Shutout In Blackjack

In the game of blackjack, any player who achieves a total card count of 21 using only two cards is said to have scored a blackjack. This is an automatic win for the player, unless the dealer also has a blackjack. When one or both players achieve this score, it is called a “natural” and pays out at 3:2 odds.

Achieving a blackjack can be very lucrative; however, there are also times when it can be quite risky. For example, if the player has an ace and a six as their first two cards, they have a total of 17. If they take another card (a seven), their total will be 24 which is not close to 21 and would likely result in them losing the hand to the dealer.

One of the most renowned professional blackjack players of all time was Charles C. “Pumpkin” Hasek. Hasek was known for his incredible skills at the game and holds the record for most World Series of Blackjack appearances with 18. In one particularly impressive performance, he achieved a blackjack against 10 different dealers in a row!

Hasek credits much of his success to his huge betting spread which often caused other players to become unnerved and make mistakes. He was also known for being very aggressive in his play; often doubling down on weaker hands in order to increase his chances of winning.

#  Dominant Hasek Shuts Out Blackjack

In a matchup of two of the NHL's top netminders, Dominik Hasek and Marty Turco, it was the Detroit Red Wings' Hasek who got the best of the Dallas Stars' Turco.

Hasek stopped all 28 shots he faced to lead Detroit to a 3-0 victory.

It was the first time this season that Dallas was shut out.

"We did a great job in front of him," said Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman. "He (Hasek) made some great saves."

Red Wings coach Dave Lewis added: "Dominik played an excellent game for us."

Hasek now has six shutouts on the season.

#  Hasek's Great Shutout Against Blackjack

Tomas Hasek has a great hockey career. But his most impressive game didn't come in the NHL. On December 19, 1997, he shut out Blackjack in an exhibition game between HC Litvinov and PSG Zlin.

To this day, it's still the only time a team has been shut out in a professional match by Hasek. And it's not just because of his goaltending skills. "Hasek played very well that evening," said Frantisek Musil, one of the players on the other team. "But we also had some good luck."

The game was scoreless until late in the third period, when Michal Klema finally managed to score for Litvinov. Musil says that moment was a relief for both teams. "It was getting a bit tense," he said. "Especially since Hasek was stopping everything we threw at him."

In the end, Hasek's shutout was an impressive victory against a talented team. And it remains one of his most memorable moments on the ice.

#  Hasek shuts out Blackjack, again!

The Detroit Red Wings continued their winning ways with a 2-0 shutout of the Blackjack team on Sunday. Goaltender Dominik Hasek was stellar once again, stopping all 33 shots he faced for his second consecutive shutout.

Forward Pavel Datsyuk opened the scoring with a powerplay goal at 8:39 of the first period. Defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom added an insurance goal midway through the third period to seal the victory for Detroit.

The Red Wings are now 4-1-0 and sit in first place in the Central Division.
