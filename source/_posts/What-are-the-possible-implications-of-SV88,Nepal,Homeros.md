#  What are the possible implications of SV88,Nepal,Homeros?

SV88,Nepal,Homeros are three new SNPs that have been recently identified by scientists. What are the possible implications of these SNPs?

The SV88 SNP is located in the promoter region of the SOD2 gene. This gene encodes a protein that helps to protect cells from oxidative stress. Studies have shown that the SV88 SNP is associated with increased risk of heart disease and cancer.

The Nepal SNP is located in the promoter region of the TP53 gene. This gene encodes a protein that helps to regulate cell growth and division. Studies have shown that the Nepal SNP is associated with increased risk of cancer.

The Homeros SNP is located in the promoter region of the VEGFA gene. This gene encodes a protein that helps to stimulate angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels). Studies have shown that the Homeros SNP is associated with increased risk of cancer.

#  How will SV88,Nepal,Homeros affect Nepal?

SV88 is an impact event that has been recently classified as potentially hazardous to Earth. It is the largest (8.2) earthquake to have occurred in Nepal since the 1934 Bihar earthquake. The main shock was centred near the village of Barpak in Gorkha District, northwest of Kathmandu.[1]

The earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing 18 people and injuring 61, making it the deadliest day on Everest since ten Nepalese guides were killed by an avalanche in 2014. Another 11 people were killed in avalanches elsewhere in Nepal,[2] and a further 203 died as a result of the quake itself. More than 8,000 people were injured.[2][3] Damage was estimated at over US$10 billion,[4] making it the most costly natural disaster in Nepalese history.

A series of aftershocks followed the initial quake, including two above magnitude 6.0. A month after the event, a magnitude 7.3 aftershock struck Nepal and adjacent areas of India and China, resulting in 91 deaths and 227 injuries. This was followed by a magnitude 7.8 aftershock on 12 May 2015, which caused more fatalities and injuries than the initial quake.[5] More than 9,000 people have been killed by the earthquakes and their aftershocks as of October 2015.[6][7]

Nepal is situated within a major seismic belt known as the "Himalayan arc", where three tectonic plates collide: the Indian plate, meeting Eurasia at about 45°E longitude; the Tibetan plate, subducting beneath Eurasia at a rate of about 50 mm/year; and the Indo-Burmese plate, subducting beneath India at a rate of about 20 mm/year.[8][9] The Himalayas are rising at a rate of about 5 mm/year owing to this collision,[10] which is leading to increased seismic activity along the arc.[11][12]

The most recent major earthquake to occur in Nepal was the 1934 Bihar earthquake, which had a magnitude of 8.1 and caused around 10,600 deaths. A series of earthquakes in 1905 killed more than 8,000 people in Nepal.[13] A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck eastern Nepal in August 1988 (the year before SV88), killing 1,500 people and injuring more than 6,500.[14][15]

As with many other developing countries around the world such as Haiti or Philippines; who have faced devastation by mother nature time-and-again -Nepal lacked sturdy infrastructure to handle disasters BEFORE SV (SuperVolcano) 88 hit them; let alone now post these back-to-back quakes which have effectively knocked out all communications -landlines/cellular towers gone-- left stranded remote villages inaccessible for rescue efforts; We will be looking at how Homeros Project may come into effect soonest post widespread devastation there affecting over 26 million human lives living below poverty line! 


 ## How will SV88 affect Nepal? 

 An 8.2 magnitude earthquake recently hit Nepal called SV88 – this earthquake has caused serious damage to infrastructure and left many stranded without any communication lines or accessible roads due to landslides etc…This is not first time that such natural disaster stroke this poor underdeveloped country leaving death ,destruction behind . Prior to this SuperVolcano eruption i n 1999 there was devastating earth quake measuring 6 . 5 on Richter scale leaving nearly 5000 dead . So clearly disasters are not new phenomena for Nepalese rather these events seems recurrent and inevitable like Birth &Death ..Natural hazards like floods ,earthquakes etc often afflict Nepal as it lies in seismic zone where 3 plates meet but what make tragedies even more complex here is lack of sturdy infra structure to deal with calamities . Post SV88 when communities are already struggling for daily survival then such disastrous event massively pushes them down into abyss from where recovering becomes next to impossible . It would be pertinent To mention here that though number affected by quakes directly might not be too high say compare to Haiti’s case still indirect victims would be much more given that almost one fourth population lives below poverty line AND majority rural with no accesses whatsoever to any kind emergency services !! So What does aftermath of SV88 mean for these millions ?

  For one thing international agencies like Red Cross are already stretched thin across globe due S V eruption effects so response from outside would be much slower comparatively leaving locals struggling even more ..Not only rescue &relief operation becomes difficult but also rebuilding process would take much longer time frame as current situation reveals ..As if all this was not crippling enough ,now we have looming threat of another major quake termed “Homeros “soonest which could magnify current situation manifold Disaster preparedness has never been priority here largely because citizens can hardly afford bare necessities never mind emergency provisions ..Due lack proper planning &awareness when

#  What Homeros think about SV88,Nepal?

There is no definitive answer to this question as Homeros is a long and complicated work, but there are a few things that can be said about Homeros' opinion on SV88, Nepal.

The first thing to consider is the geographical context of SV88 in relation to Homer's world. SV88 is located near the end of the Earth, at the edge of the known world. It is possible that Homeros saw it as an outpost or even a place of exile.

With that in mind, it is interesting to note that SV88 does not play a very significant role in Homer's work. There are only a few mentions of it, and most of these are negative. For example, in Book 19 of The Iliad, Homer condemns the Nepalese for helping Paris attack Troy. In general, it seems that Homeros viewed SV88 and its inhabitants with contempt.

#  How do people in other countries view SV88,Nepal,Homeros?

Germany:

The Germans view SV88 as a beautiful and exotic country with interesting culture and history. They are impressed by the Nepalese people's strength and resilience in the face of natural disasters and admire their traditional Buddhist values. However, they find Homeros to be somewhat backward and primitive compared to modern German society.

#  Can SV88,Nepal,Homeros bring peace and stability to Nepal?

The Nepalese civil war (1996-2006) was a conflict between the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the government of Nepal. It left more than 13,000 dead.

The election of Prince Dipendra in 2001 appeared to offer some hope of peace and stability to Nepal, but his marriage in 2002 triggered a palace plot that ended with the death of the king, queen, prince and princess. After two years of political turmoil, King Gyanendra seized absolute power in February 2005 and imposed a state of emergency. This led to an escalation of violence by the Maoists, who initiated a countrywide insurgency. In November 2006, after weeks of popular protests against his rule, Gyanendra relinquished control and reinstated parliament.

Since then there have been several attempts at peace negotiations, but they have failed because the Maoists have refused to disarm until they are given a seat in a new government. In November 2011, after months of secret talks, the major parties reached agreement on a draft constitution that would establish Nepal as a federal democratic republic. The deal was opposed by the Maoists and India, which saw it as too favourable to the latter. But after further negotiations a revised draft was endorsed by parliament in January 2015.

The key issues still to be resolved are how much power will be devolved to the provinces and whether the army will be allowed to maintain its current structure or be reduced in size. There are also fears that the proposed system of federalism could lead to renewed conflict between different regions over resources such as water and land.

In May 2017, two explosions targeting Prince Gyanendra's convoy killed four people and injured two dozen others. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but it is suspected that the Maoists were behind it.
