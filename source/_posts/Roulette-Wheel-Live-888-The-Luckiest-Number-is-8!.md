#  Roulette Wheel Live 888: The Luckiest Number is 8!

In roulette, the wheel has 36 numbers spread equally around it. 18 of these are red and 18 black, with a green zero in between. The aim of the game is to choose a number or group of numbers and predict which slot on the wheel the ball will end up in after being spun. Players can bet on one or more numbers, colors, whether the number will be odd or even, and other options.

Players always gamble against the house, so there is always a small percentage that the house will win no matter what number you pick. However, some numbers are luckier than others!

The luckiest number in roulette is 8! Not only does 8 have its own special color (green), but it also has the lowest house edge of any other number – just 2.7%. This means that for every £100 you bet on 8, you’ll only lose £2.70 on average. So if you’re feeling lucky, make sure to put your bets on 8!
