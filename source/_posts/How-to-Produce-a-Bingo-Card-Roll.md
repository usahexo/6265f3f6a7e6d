#  How to Produce a Bingo Card Roll

People playing bingo for the first time generally have no idea how to produce their card roll. The following describes the process:

The object of the game is to mark off numbers on your bingo card until you get five in a row, column, or diagonal. The game starts by selecting any number on the card and calling it out. The caller then proceeds to mark that number off with a dauber. Players take turns calling out numbers until somebody gets five in a row and wins the game.

Here's how to produce your card roll:

1) Select any number on your bingo card and call it out. For this example, we'll use the number 5. 
2) Draw a vertical line 5 spaces down from the 5 on your card and put an X through that space. 
3) Starting with the 6th space to the right of the 5, draw 6 more vertical lines (representing the numbers 6 through 10). 
4) Put an X through the last space in each of those 7 lines (representing the numbers 6 through 10). 
5) That completes producing your card roll for number 5. To produce your card roll for any other number, simply repeat these same instructions using that number in place of 5.

This is an easy project that can be made with materials you may already have on hand. It’s a fun game to play with friends and family, and it also makes for a great party game.

To make a Bingo Roller, you will need:

-A bowl or other container that will hold the ping pong balls
-A cardboard tube, at least 2 inches in diameter
-Hot glue gun and glue sticks
-Ruler or yardstick
-Pens or pencils
-Ping pong balls

1. Draw a grid of 5 rows by 5 columns on the cardboard tube using a ruler or yardstick. Use a pen or pencil to draw the lines really well, as these will be your guides when assembling the game.
2. Cut along the lines you just drew with scissors. You now have a grid of 25 squares.
3. Glue the top edge of one end of the cardboard tube to the bottom edge of one square on the grid, making sure the edges are straight. Hold in place until it dries. Do the same thing to the opposite corner so that you have created a triangular shape. 
4. Glue another square next to the first one, creating a rectangle shape. Make sure that all of the edges are straight and there is about 1/4 inch between each side of the square and the sides of the rectangle. 
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have glued all of the squares together except for two opposite corners. Leave those two corners unglued for now. 
6. Fill the bowl with ping pong balls until it’s full (you may need to shake them around a bit so they are all sitting at the bottom). Now carefully tip it over so that all of the balls fall out into one corner of your assembled game board. This will be your “jackpot” corner. 
7. Glue one of the loose corners closed, being careful not to get any glue on top of the ping pong balls in your jackpot corner! 8 Allow everything to dry completely before playing your new Bingo Roller!
