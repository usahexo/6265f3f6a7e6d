#  Tajikistan To Legalize Online Poker

The tiny central Asian country of Tajikistan is all set to legalize online poker, according to a report in the local media.

The news outlet Asia Plus quoted Rustam Inoyatov, the chairman of the country’s Supreme Court, as saying that the government was working on a bill to legalize the game.

If things go as planned, Tajikistan could become the latest in a growing list of countries to legalize online poker. Just last year, Japan legalized the game, and other jurisdictions such as Malta and Gibraltar are also keen on attracting online poker operators.

This is great news for fans of the game in Tajikistan, who have been without a legal option to play for some time now. The move is also likely to attract foreign operators to set up shop in Tajikistan, creating new jobs and generating much-needed revenue for the government.

So far, there has been no indication of when the bill might be introduced or what its exact provisions will be. However, it is clear that the authorities are keen on regulating the game and ensuring that it is played fairly and responsibly.

This is good news for players too, as it means they can expect a safe and secure gaming experience with quality customer support. As online poker becomes more mainstream, we can expect even more operators to enter this growing market.

#  Tajikistan Holds First Ever International Poker Tournament

In the heart of Central Asia, in the country of Tajikistan, a new chapter was written in the annals of poker history as the country hosted its very first international poker tournament. The event, which took place at the Dushanbe Hilton hotel, drew players from all over the region, including Russia and Kazakhstan.

The tournament itself was a success, with many thrilling games taking place. In the end, it was Rustam Yussupov who took home the title and the top prize of $10,000. Yussupov is one of Russia’s most successful poker players, so it was no surprise that he managed to come out on top.

What may have been more surprising was the performance of some of the other players at the tournament. For example, Timur Margolin – who is usually considered one of Russia’s strongest poker players – only finished in 9th place. This goes to show that no-one can be taken for granted in an international poker tournament like this one.

The high level of competition also made for some exciting games. One particular hand that stood out saw two Russian players go all in before the flop. The eventual winner ended up being Sergey Karpukhin, who eliminated his opponent and scooped up a nice pot worth over $4,000.

Overall, the Dushanbe Hilton International Poker Tournament proved to be a great success. With so much interest and excitement surrounding it, there is no doubt that we can expect similar tournaments to take place in Tajikistan in years to come.

#  Could Poker Finally Be Coming To Tajikistan?

It appears that poker may finally be coming to Tajikistan. A recent article in the Asia-Pacific Poker Tour (APPT) website discusses the possibility of a new poker room opening in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan.

The APPT article quotes Enes Zangirov, the President of the Tajikistan Poker Association, as saying that the country's first legal poker room could open within six months. Zangirov says that the new room would be operated by the Association and would offer both cash games and tournaments.

Tajikistan is a small country in central Asia with a population of just over 8 million people. It is not an obvious choice for a poker destination, but there are some reasons why it could work.

First of all, Tajikistan has a sizable expat community, many of whom would no doubt be keen to play poker. There are also plenty of tourists visiting Dushanbe, and they too might be interested in giving poker a try.

The other key factor is that Tajikistan is relatively affordable compared to some other nearby countries. The cost of living in Dushanbe is relatively low, and this could make it attractive for poker players looking for a bargain Asian getaway.

There are still some hurdles to overcome before Tajikistan becomes a major poker destination. The country lacks any real infrastructure for gambling, and it's not clear how easily foreigners will be able to obtain visas. There also isn't much information available about the proposed poker room in Dushanbe, so it's possible that there may still be some underlying issues that need to be resolved.

Nonetheless, the news that poker may finally be coming to Tajikistan is definitely exciting news for fans of the game in central Asia. With any luck, we should see some big things happening in the next few months and Tajikistan could soon become a popular spot on the global poker circuit.
