#  Astros Surge to New Heights in 2nd Half, Winning Record and Playoffs in Sight

Houston, TX - The Houston Astros have been one of the most surprising stories of the 2017 MLB season. After a dismal first half, they surged to new heights in the second half, winning a respectable 54 games to finish with a winning record and playoff hopes alive.

Leading the way for the Astros has been MVP candidate Jose Altuve. The diminutive second baseman has been on an absolute tear, batting .347/.410/.561 with 24 home runs and 30 stolen bases. Altuve is joined by fellow All-Stars Carlos Correa and George Springer in a loaded Astros lineup that can go toe-to-toe with any team in baseball.

The bullpen has also been a major strength for Houston, anchored by Ken Giles and Chris Devenski. Giles has been one of the most dominant closers in baseball this season, racking up 34 saves while posting a 2.30 ERA. Devenski has been equally impressive as a multi-inning reliever, posting a 2.88 ERA while averaging more than one strikeout per inning pitched.

Houston will need to continue playing at a high level if they hope to make the playoffs for the first time since 2005. However, with their talented roster and hot streak, anything is possible for this young Astros team.

#  Astros Eyeing Division Lead as They Tower Above Competition

Houston Astros, the reigning World Series champions, have recovered quite well from their devastating loss in Game 7 and are now eyeing a division lead as they tower above competition.

After a hot start to the season, the Astros have slumped a bit as of late but still find themselves with a comfortable 11-game lead in the American League West division. The offense has been among the best in baseball averaging 5.5 runs per game. José Altuve continues to be one of the most valuable players in all of baseball by batting .316 with 16 home runs and 63 RBIs.

The pitching staff has also been very good this year led by Justin Verlander who is 10-6 with a 2.52 ERA and 1.05 WHIP. Gerrit Cole has also been great since being traded over from Pittsburgh Pirates last year, compiling an 8-1 record with a 2.88 ERA. This formidable duo should help the Astros make another deep playoff run later this year.

While the competition for the AL West crown may not be as strong as it was in years past, it is still important for Houston to take care of business and clinch the division as quickly as possible to avoid any late-season drama. With that said, it is hard to see any team other than the Astros coming out on top in the West this season.

#  Astros Soar to New Heights With Continued Winning Ways

The Houston Astros continue to dazzle baseball fans as they soar to new heights. The team is now leading their division and looking poised for a deep playoff run.

One of the key contributors to the Astros’ success has been pitcher Justin Verlander. Verlander, who was traded to the Astros in August 2017, has been stellar this season. He is currently ranked first in the American League in strikeouts and second in ERA.

Verlander’s dominance on the mound has helped silence any doubters who questioned the team's decision to trade for him last year. In addition to his pitching prowess, Verlander also provides a veteran presence in the locker room that young players can look up to.

Houston's other star pitcher, Dallas Keuchel, has also played a major role in the team's success. Keuchel is currently fourth in the American League in ERA and has been especially dominant at home, where he is 7-0 with a 1.29 ERA this season.

The Astros' high-powered offense has also played a major role in their success. Led by MVP candidate Jose Altuve, the Astros are averaging 5.5 runs per game this season. Altuve is currently leading the American League in batting average and hits, and is second in home runs and RBIs.

The Astros will look to continue their winning ways as they head into the postseason. With their talented roster and passionate fans cheering them on, there's no telling how far they can go!

#  Houston Astros Climb the Ranks and Continue to Show Dominance in the MLB

Houston Astros have been on a roll recently, climbing up the ranks and proving their dominance in the MLB. With their latest win against the Seattle Mariners, they are now at the top of the American League West Division with a record of 73-42.

The Houston Astros lineup has proved to be unstoppable this season. Led by José Altuve, who is currently in the race for MVP, the Astros offense is one of the best in the league. They have also been getting great pitching from Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole, both of whom were recently traded to the Astros.

The Astros are looking like a force to be reckoned with and are on track to make it to the World Series this year. If they can keep up their current momentum, there’s no doubt that they will be one of the teams to beat in the playoffs.
