#  Casino Night Highlights

Casino night is always a highlight of the year for students. Hundreds of students flock to the Student Union for an evening of fun and games. This year, casino night was extra special because it was the last one before the renovation project starts.

The games were set up in the main ballroom and there was a range of different activities to choose from. Some students played blackjack or poker, while others tried their luck at slots or roulette. There was even a charity raffle with some great prizes up for grabs.

The highlight of the night was definitely the casino tournament. Students battled it out all night long to see who would be crowned champion. In the end, it was James Mitchell who took home the crown and the prize money.

 Casino night is always a lot of fun and it’s great to see so many students come out and enjoy themselves. I’m sure everyone is looking forward to casino night next year, especially now that it will be taking place in the new Student Union building!
