#  I'm A Pro Poker Player - And I'm Not Even Close To 10,000 Hands In Zone Hold'em Poker 4 Tabling Spin Casino 

I’ve been playing poker for a while now. I wouldn’t say I’m an expert, but I’m definitely no beginner. And I can tell you that my record in Zone Hold ‘em Poker is far from 10,000 hands. In fact, I’d be surprised if I was even close to that number.

I know a lot of people like to boast about how many hands they’ve played in order to prove their prowess at the table. But in my opinion, that experience doesn’t really mean anything if you haven’t put in the hours playing different variants of the game.

That’s why I focus on playing 4 tables of Zone Hold ‘em Poker at Spin Casino . It gives me the opportunity to play a lot of hands without having to sit at a table for hours on end. And it also helps me make more money since the games are so fast-paced.

Sure, I could probably make more money if I increased the stakes and played at a higher level of competition. But for now, I’m happy with my current ROI and chip stack size. Besides, there’s always time to move up in stakes later on down the road.

In any case, don’t let anybody tell you that you need to play 10,000 hands before you can call yourself a pro poker player. There are plenty of other ways to improve your skills – and 4 tables of Zone Hold ‘em Poker is one of them!

#  It Took Me Over 200 Hours To Reach 10,000 Hands In Zone Hold'em Poker 4 Tabling Spin Casino 

I’ve finally achieved 10,000 hands in Zone Hold'em Poker 4 tabling Spin Casino. I first started playing on September 12th and it took me over 200 hours of play to reach this milestone.

Throughout this grind, I’ve picked up a lot of useful information that I thought I would share. Hopefully, some of you can take something away from this that helps you in your own poker journey.

# The Importance of Discipline 

No matter what game you’re playing, discipline is key. This was especially true for me during my grind to 10,000 hands. You have to be able to maintain focus for extended periods of time and not let yourself get tilted.

There were times when I lost a lot of money in short period of time, but I was able to keep grinding because I had the discipline to stick to my plan. If you don’t have the discipline to stay focused, then your results are going to suffer.

# Bankroll Management is Crucial 

One mistake that a lot of players make is not managing their bankroll properly. This was something that I had to be mindful of during my grind, as going on tilt could easily lead to a broke bankroll.

You need to make sure that you are comfortable playing the stakes that you are playing at. If you are not comfortable playing at a certain level, then you should move down until you are comfortable. Conversely, if you are winning at a certain level, then you should move up until you reach the next level where you are comfortable losing."

#  I Didn't Expect It To Take This Long To Reach 10,000 Hands In Zone Hold'em Poker 4 Tabling Spin Casino 

I started playing poker in November of 2016. I had just turned 21 and was looking for something to do on the weekends. I had dabbled in poker a little bit in high school and college, but nothing serious. I decided to give it a go again and discovered the wonderful world of online poker.

I started out by playing $2/$4 zoom on PokerStars. Within a week or two, I was up to $1,000. I then started playing $5/$10 and pretty quickly moved up to $10/$20. My winning streak continued and after a few months, I had built my bankroll up to over $10,000.

I then decided to move up to the next level and started playing $25/$50. This was a big jump for me, as I was only used to playing stakes of $5/$10 or lower. But I was confident in my abilities and thought that I could make some money at this level. Unfortunately, this is where my poker journey hit a snag.

I quickly lost most of my bankroll and found myself down over $3,000. I wasn't sure what went wrong, but I knew that I needed to make some changes if I wanted to succeed at this level. After taking some time off from poker, I decided to give it another go.

This time around, I was more patient and took my time adapting to the new level before committing any large sums of money. It took me about two months, but eventually I regained my losses and even managed to turn a small profit.

The key thing that I learned from this experience was that patience is key when moving up in stakes. You can't just jump into a game with players who are much better than you and expect to win. You need to take your time and learn how to play against these types of players before risking any significant amount of money.

#  Reaching 10,000 Hands In Zone Hold'em Poker 4 Tabling Spin Casino Is harder Than It Looks 

Reaching 10,000 hands in Zone Hold'em Poker 4 tabling Spin Casino can be harder than it looks. Especially if you are a recreational player that is trying to reach this milestone. I have been playing poker for 5 years now and I am still not at 10,000 hands. I am close, but not quite there.

My biggest issue is that I do not play enough volume. If I want to make a serious push to get to 10,000 hands in the next month, then I need to play about 25 sessions per day – which is not realistic for me. Even if I could find the time to play that much, it would be very tiring and wearing on my mind and body.

So what is the alternative? The alternative is to find ways to increase my overall win rate so that I can achieve 10,000 hands in a shorter amount of time. For example, if I can increase my win rate from 0.5NL to 1NL then I can reach 10,000 hands in 20 sessions (or 400 hours). This would be much more achievable and less taxing on my body and mind.

So how do we go about increasing our win rate? Well, there are actually quite a few things that we can do: 

1) Study the game more – learn about different playing strategies and how to apply them. There are plenty of great books out there on poker theory as well as online resources such as articles and videos.
  2) Get better at decision-making – this includes being able to quickly calculate odds and math problems in your head during a hand. Also important is being able to read your opponents and make decisions based on their tendencies/tells. 
  3) Improve your basic skills – things like pot odds, implied odds, stack sizes etc. Even if you don’t know all the answers off by heart, just having an understanding of these concepts will help you make better decisions at the table. 

4) Practice regularly – this might seem like a no-brainer, but many players don’t practice enough (or at all). If you want to improve your game then you need to put in the hours at the table! 
5) Play against better players – nothing will help your game more than playing against better competition. It will force you to up your game and learn new strategies in order to stay competitive. 
6) Stay disciplined – one of the biggest issues for most recreational players is Discipline . This includes things like staying focused during a session, avoiding tilt , etc. It can be tough sometimes but it’s crucial if you want to improve your long-term results at the table
