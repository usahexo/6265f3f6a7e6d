#  Tomas Hertl scores 8 goals in a single game!

On October 8, 2013, Tomas Hertl of the San Jose Sharks scored 8 goals in a single game against the New York Rangers. This was only the second time in NHL history that a player had scored 8 goals in a single game. The first time it had happened was in 1936, when Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens scored 8 goals.

Hertl's 8 goals were a combination of power play goals, short-handed goals, and even strength goals. He became only the third player in NHL history to score multiple short-handed goals in one game and also became only the fifth player to score 3 power play goals in one game.

Hertl's incredible performance helped the Sharks to an impressive 9-2 victory over the Rangers. It was an amazing offensive outburst from Hertl, who is only 20 years old and had never before scored more than 2 goals in a single game.

Looking back on Tomas Hertl's record-breaking night, it is clear that he is one of the most talented young players in the NHL today. With his mixture of speed, power, and scoring ability, Hertl is sure to be a dominant force for many years to come.

#  Detroit Red Wings win AGAIN with 8 shutout from Dominik Hasek

The Detroit Red Wings have been on an amazing winning streak recently, and it doesn't look like it's going to end any time soon! The latest victory was an 8-0 shutout against the Ottawa Senators, with goalie Dominik Hasek getting 3 of those 8 goals. This makes 8 consecutive wins for Detroit, who are now firmly in first place in their division.

It's been a fantastic season so far for the Red Wings, and they show no signs of slowing down. With superstar players like Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg leading the team, it's clear that they're a force to be reckoned with. The defense has also been playing extremely well lately, thanks in part to stalwart player Nicklas Lidstrom.

Detroit is looking good for the playoffs this year, and there's a good chance they could go all the way. If they keep playing like this, nobody will be able to stop them!

#  New York Rangers score only 8 goals in 6 games against Buffalo Sabres

In a surprising turn of events, the New York Rangers were only able to score 8 goals in their six-game series against the Buffalo Sabres. In the first game alone, they put up 5 goals against Robin Lehner, but they would only score 3 more goals against Linus Ullmark for the rest of the series.

Jeff Skinner was a key player for the Sabres in this matchup, as he scored 4 goals and added an assist. Rasmus Dahlin also had a strong performance, notching his first NHL playoff goal along with 2 assists.

The Rangers now find themselves down 2-0 in their best-of-seven series, and will need to come up with some big performances in order to make a comeback.

#  Washington Capitals place their bet on 8 and win

The Washington Capitals have decided to place their bet on 8, and they are winning so far. They are currently in first place in the division and the conference, with a record of 42-18-8. This is thanks, in part, to their strong offense. Their top scorer is Alexander Ovechkin, who has scored 36 goals this season.

The Capitals also have a strong defense. Goalie Braden Holtby has been playing well, and the team has only allowed 171 goals this season. This is the second fewest in the league.

The Capitals are looking to make a deep playoff run this year. They seem like they have a good chance of doing so, as they are one of the top teams in the league. Ovechkin will need to continue scoring goals if they want to win the Stanley Cup.

#  8 proves to be a lucky number for Pittsburgh Penguins as they score an important victory with that final score

The Pittsburgh Penguins were looking to rebound from their Game 1 loss to the Washington Capitals and they did just that with a huge 8-7 victory in Game 2. This was an important game for Pittsburgh as they don’t want to go down 2-0 in the series.

The Penguins got off to a great start in this game as they scored four goals in the first period. They had some amazing scoring chances throughout the game and it was only a matter of time before they would score again.

Pittsburgh proved to be too much for Washington as they scored four more goals in the second period. This was an exciting game to watch and there were some great goals scored by both teams.

The Capitals made a comeback in the third period and scored three times, but it wasn’t enough as the Penguins held on for the victory. Sidney Crosby had a great game with two goals and two assists, while Evgeni Malkin had a hat trick.

This was an exciting game to watch and it showed that both teams are evenly matched. The Capitals will need to make some adjustments for Game 3 if they want to win this series.
