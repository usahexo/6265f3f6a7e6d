#  Rotogrinders Excel Site Updated for Sports Betting Data

The Rotogrinders sports betting data site has been updated with new features for the 2018-19 NFL season.

For NFL bettors, the Rotogrinders site is a must-use tool. In addition to the usual stats and rankings, the site now offers datafiles that can be used to create custom projections.

There are also several new filters that can be used to isolate specific data points. For example, you can now see how a team performs both at home and on the road.

The site also includes betting trends and matchup analysis. This can be valuable information when creating your NFL betting strategy for the week.

Be sure to check out the Rotogrinders NFL data site before placing any bets this season!

#  How to Transfer Sports Betting Data Into Excel

Excel is a versatile program that can be used for a variety of tasks, including sports betting. In order to make the most of Excel when it comes to sports betting, you need to know how to import your data from betting sites into the software.

There are a few different ways to do this, but we'll show you how to do it using the VBA code editor. This tutorial is for Windows users only.

1. Open Excel and go to the VBA editor by pressing Alt + F11.

2. In the Project Explorer pane on the left, select Module1. This is where we'll write our code.

3. Paste the following code into the Module1 window:

Sub ImportData() 'Declare variables Dim url As String Dim bet As String Dim runner As String Dim tabler As String Dim data As Range Dim sheetname As String 'Get input from user url = InputBox("Please enter the URL of your betting site:") bet = InputBox("Please enter your bet:") runner = InputBox("Please enter runner number:") tabler = InputBox("Please enter table number:") 'Import data into Excel Sheets IIf(url <> "", Worksheets(url).Activate, End Sub) IIf(bet <> "", ActiveSheet.Cells(bet, 1), End Sub) IIf(runner <> "", ActiveSheet.Cells(runner, 1), End Sub) IIf(tabler <> "", ActiveSheet.Cells(tabler, 1), End Sub) End Sub

4. In the code, change the text in bold to match your information. Be sure to include quotation marks around text that is enclosed in quotes.

5. Save the file ( File > Save ) and close Excel.

6. Open Excel again and press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.

7. Click Run > Run Sub/UserForm . This will run the code we just wrote and import your data into Excel.
