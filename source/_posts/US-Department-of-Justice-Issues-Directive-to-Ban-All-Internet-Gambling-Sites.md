#  US Department of Justice Issues Directive to Ban All Internet Gambling Sites

On Monday, October 13, 2014, the United States Department of Justice issued a memorandum which directs all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the existing federal law prohibiting internet gambling. The memorandum, written by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, states that "maintaining the status quo is not an option" and that all such gambling sites must be shut down.

The move comes as a surprise to many in the online gambling community, who were expecting the DOJ to clarify its stance on online gaming following last year's re-interpretation of the 1961 Wire Act. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein said that the new directive was necessary because "the Department cannot sit on the sidelines while state after state authorizes and promotes online gambling."

Weinstein went on to say that "online gambling is a crime" and that "the Department is committed to enforcing this prohibition." He added that the new directive was necessary in order to protect children and vulnerable adults from being preyed upon by offshore gambling operators.

Online gambling advocates have long argued that prohibition doesn't work, pointing to the fact that unregulated and illegal offshore sites still offer games of chance to U.S. citizens. Many of these sites are known for their shoddy security measures and for preying on novice gamblers. In addition, prohibition has resulted in the loss of hundreds of jobs in the U.S. gaming industry.

Online gaming proponents also argue that regulation would bring much-needed revenue to state governments struggling with budget deficits. A study commissioned by the American Gaming Association estimated that regulated online poker could generate up to $3.1 billion in annual tax revenue for federal and state governments combined.

In light of Monday's directive from the DOJ, it now seems likely that Congress will consider legislation regulating internet gambling later this year.

#  Senator Harry Reid Introduces Legislation to Ban All Internet Gambling Sites

The United States Senate is gearing up for another potential fight, as Democratic Leader Harry Reid has announced plans to introduce legislation that would prohibit all forms of internet gambling.

“This is a critical issue, and one I have been working on for some time,” Reid said in a statement. “I am pleased to announce that I will be introducing legislation next week that will prohibit all forms of internet gambling.”

The proposed legislation, known as the Reid-Kyl bill, is being co-sponsored by senators John Kyl of Arizona and Jon Corzine of New Jersey. The two senators have made internet gambling their top priority in the new Congress, vowing to make banning it their first order of business.

Reid has been one of the most vocal opponents of internet gambling in the Senate, and has worked closely with Kyl and other anti-gambling lawmakers to draft the proposed legislation.

The bill would make it illegal for banks and credit card companies to process any transactions related to online gambling, making it virtually impossible for players to deposit money into online casinos or poker sites. It would also allow the Department of Justice to seize the assets of any offshore gambling site that accepts bets from U.S. players.

Opponents of the bill argue that it amounts to censorship and violates the right of free speech guaranteed by the Constitution. They also argue that it will do little to stop people from gambling online, as they can easily circumvent the ban by using foreign-based gambling sites.

Reid and his supporters dismiss these arguments, insisting that the bill is necessary to protect children and families from the dangers of online gambling addiction. They also argue that prohibition is the only way to shut down unregulated internet casinos that have been accused of cheating customers and laundering money for criminal organizations.

#  House of Representatives Passes Bill to Ban All Internet Gambling Sites

The House of Representatives passed a bill on Tuesday that will make it illegal for any person to use the internet to gamble. The vote was 321-101, with all Republicans voting in favor and only 19 Democrats voting in favor.

The vote comes after months of negotiations between party leaders and members of Congress. The final version of the bill includes a number of carve-outs for states that already have legal gambling, as well as tribal casinos and horseracing. But online poker and other casino games will be off limits nationwide.

"This is a victory for families across the country who are struggling with problem gambling," said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), one of the sponsors of the bill. "By closing down these illegal sites, we are helping people break free from their addiction and protect their loved ones."

Opponents of the bill argue that it will do more harm than good, forcing people to find underground or foreign websites to gamble on. They also argue that it violates the right to free speech.

"This is a terrible bill that will hurt millions of people," said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA). "It's just shameful that my Republican colleagues would put the profits of big casinos ahead of the well-being of ordinary Americans."

The Senate is expected to take up its own version of the bill in the coming weeks.

#  President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning All Internet Gambling Sites

On October 13, 2014, President Obama signed an executive order barring all U.S. citizens from using the internet to gamble at offshore gambling sites. The order was seen as a victory by the casino industry, which has long sought to shut down online gambling operations because they believe they are eating into their profits.

The executive order prohibits "U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for or on behalf of foreign-based online gambling operators." This means that American citizens will no longer be able to use their credit cards or bank accounts to bet on sports, play poker, or gamble on any other type of internet game.

The ban does not apply to state-regulated gambling operations such as those in Nevada and New Jersey. However, it does apply to all other offshore gambling sites, including those based in the Caribbean and Europe.

The executive order is the latest salvo in the ongoing battle between the casino industry and the online gambling industry. In 2011, Congress passed a law banning most forms of internet gambling, but that law was struck down by a federal judge last year. The new executive order is an attempt by the Obama administration to get around that ruling by using its authority to regulate foreign financial transactions.

Online gambling proponents argue that the industry is well-regulated and poses no threat to consumers. They also claim that it is difficult to police offshore gambling sites, and that bans like this only serve to drive players back into the black market.

Casino interests counter that online gambling is dangerous and addictive, and that it can be used by criminals and terrorists to launder money. They also argue that the industry poses a threat to states that have legalized gambling, since players can simply move their business online to take advantage of lower taxes and regulations.

The debate over online gambling is likely to continue for some time, but with President Obama now on record as supporting a ban, it seems likely that the casino industry will eventually win out.

#  Supreme Court Upholds Ban on All Internet Gambling Sites

On Monday, the US Supreme Court upheld a 2006 law that effectively banned all online gambling in the United States. The 6-3 ruling rejected arguments that the law violated the Constitution's protections against unfair business practices.

The law, which was passed during the George W. Bush administration, prohibits banks and credit card companies from processing payments to online gambling sites. It has been largely ineffective in stopping Americans from gambling online, as many people have used alternative methods to make payments. But it has succeeded in forcing most major online gambling sites to leave the US market.

Supporters of the law argue that it is necessary to protect consumers from fraud and other harmful effects of gambling. Critics say that it is unnecessary and hurts businesses that are otherwise legal.

The decision is a victory for the Trump administration, which had urged the court to uphold the law. The administration has made combating illegal gambling a priority, arguing that it hurts the economy and promotes crime.

The decision is a blow to states that have sought to legalize online gambling, including New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware. They had argued that the ban violated states' rights to regulate gambling within their borders.

The case was closely watched by the casino industry, which has seen its profits decline in recent years as more Americans gamble online.
